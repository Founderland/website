- title: Founderland Calls on Europe’s Startup Ecosystem to Wake Up, Support Women of Color
  description: When Deborah Choi and Alina Bassi initially conceived of Berlin-based nonprofit Founderland, they intended it to be a one-day event for women of color entrepreneurs like themselves, with a stretch goal of 80 attendees. But the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in that plan. Instead, it grew into a full-fledged non-profit organization, which they co-founded with fellow entrepreneur Stephanie von Behr to provide support to women of color founders in Europe. It now has 400 members across 25 European countries, representing verticals from B2B to Web3.

  description: In 2020, major venture capitalists promised to do better on diversity. Few years later, there are few signs of progress. Amidst a plethora of DEI initiatives, the proportion of funding for women-only teams has only decreased in Europe. The State of European Tech shows a drop from 3 per cent to 1 per cent since 2018.

- title: The R/GA Make/Good Program Helps Close the Racial Wealth Gap
  description: In 2017, R/GA didn’t have a corporate social responsibility program. The agency’s new art director, Bayyina Black, wanted to change that. A town hall meeting helped inspire her. As Black listened to founder Bob Greenberg talking about the downturn in the economy at the time, she thought back on a Giving Trip she took with Toms Shoes. She had an idea which led to a business proposition that eventually grew into R/GA’s Make / Good for Businesses, a pro bono program that supports entrepreneurs of color.

- title: 5 Questions with the Co-Founders of Founderland
  description: 'Founderland aims to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs, by addressing the most underrepresented: women of color. Less than 0.5% of venture capital in Europe has gone to women of color founders, and we exist to increase the number of funded and resourced businesses run by diverse leadership. We believe doing so creates new representations of entrepreneurship for the next generation of founders.'
