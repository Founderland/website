- name: Britt Davis
  bio: Originally from the US, Britt Davis moved to Berlin in 2015 to pursue a career as a professional dance artist. After the height of the pandemic, she turned to embrace a second career in social media management and content creation. Since 2021, she has been working to streamline digital marketing strategies for both progressive companies and creative entrepreneurs through brand activations, influencer collaborations, relevant content creation, and innovative campaigns in the demanding, ever-growing world of social media. Her warm demeanor and fierce work ethic keep her moving forward at all times - pushing toward new creative ideas, expanding collaborative capacities, and dreaming up future opportunities. In between her infinite activities, she can be found eating pizza or sipping an Aperol Spritz - either way, she's the girl you want to be, the friend you want to hang with, AND the person you go to when you need to get sh*t done.
