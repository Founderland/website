  title: Head of Brand & Marketing at Factory Berlin
  quote: '“In order to build a more equitable and representative society, the businesses, products and projects being built for the future need to be built by people who represent all corners of society. This most importantly means underrepresented and intersectional groups: PoC, women and LGBTQIA+ people. The lack of diversity in the founder community will always be a hurdle to a more inclusive future, and organisations like Founderland are tackling this at every level. Structural obstacles to a more inclusive society can only be overcome if networks and communities like Founderland come together to spark tangible change.”'

  title: Partner at Ananda Impact Ventures
  quote: “As an impact investor I look for founders with diverse backgrounds and outlooks to solve some of the world's hardest social and environmental issues, as the existing crew in charge have not done a great job. Founderland provides Ananda with access to an incredible growing community of one of the most underinvested founder demographics in VC. It's time for a change.”
