- question: What role do Investors play in Founderland?
  answer: Investors play a critical role in how diverse the entrepreneurship landscape in Europe is. When investors register with Founderland and share details on their fund or angel investment focus, we then review, match and connect investors with relevant founders and startups within our ecosystem. We believe that doing so helps funds and angels diversify their pipelines and connect with “out of network” founders.
- question: What role do Allies play in Founderland?
  answer: The reality is, the power to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs in Europe, does not only rest with the ‘check writers’. We all have the ability to support underrepresented founders with their business strategy and road maps. This is why Founderland sees allies as essential change-makers within our ecosystem. Most allies provide their time and expertise via 1:1 virtual ‘office hours’ and/or virtual workshops for founders within our community.
- question: What is an Ally?
  answer: An ally is any person that actively promotes and aspires to advance the culture of inclusion through intentional, positive and conscious efforts that benefit people as a whole. Everyone has the ability to be an ally, as privilege is intersectional - white women can be actionable allies to people of color, men can be allies to women, cis people can be allies to members of the LGBTQI+ community, able-bodied people can be allies to those with different abilities, economically privileged people can be allies to those who are not, and so on.
