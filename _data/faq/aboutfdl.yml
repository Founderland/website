- question: What is the purpose of Founderland?
  answer: 'We aim to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs, by addressing the most underrepresented: women of colour. Less than 0.5% of venture capital in Europe has gone to women of colour founders, and we exist to increase the number of funded and resourced businesses run by diverse leadership. We believe doing so creates new representations of entrepreneurship for the next generation of founders.'
- question: Who does Founderland serve and why?
  answer: We support women of colour founders based in Europe and the UK, who’ve faced obstacles tied to their ethnicity and race in their business journeys. Our focus on women of colour means we primarily support women with ethnic background or heritage in Africa, the Caribbean, South & Central America, South & Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We believe that leveling the playing field for all entrepreneurs means addressing the most underrepresented, and that is women of colour.
- question: What services and/or benefits does Founderland provide its community?
  answer: Founderland provides peer community, mentorship, free and discounted business tools & services, inspirational events + workshops, and support with fundraising via warm introductions and pitch preparation. We will be launching our first investor-readiness accelerator in September 2022.
- question: How does Founderland measure impact?
  answer: 'Founderland measures impact across our three core pillars: peer community, increased visibility and access to capital for women of colour founders. We track the growth of our community and follow capital raised by our founders.'
