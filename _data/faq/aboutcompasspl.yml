- question: How much does Compass cost?
  answer: Compass has no cost barriers attached to it. At Founderland, our priority is to build an inclusive standard for entrepreneurs and knock down barriers that are often in place in the journeys of women of colour founders. Therefore, the program is cost-free and equity-free. All we ask is your full commitment and effort.
- question: How much time is required to participate in Compass?
  answer: The required time commitment is 10 hours weekly (4 hrs live sessions) and self-paced learning (5-7 hrs/week). However, to get the most out of Compass, we suggest that founders spend 15 hours a week on the program.
- question: I have already participated in accelerators in the past. How is Compass different from other programs?
  answer: Compass by Founderland uniquely focuses on programming designed for facing barriers in the entrepreneurial space. We hone in on teaching practices that will navigate bias in negotiation and pitching. In addition, our angel investor pairing is a unique process in which each member of the cohort is specifically paired with an angel sponsor who will serve as their advocate and facilitate warm introductions to investors.
- question: Is the program virtual?
  answer: Yes, all of the programming is virtual at this time.
