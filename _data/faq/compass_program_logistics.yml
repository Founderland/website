- question: How much does Compass cost?
  answer: At Founderland, our priority is to build an inclusive standard for entrepreneurs and knock down barriers that are often in place in the journeys of women of colour founders. Therefore, the program is cost-free and equity-free. All we ask is your full commitment and effort.
- question: How much time is required to participate in Compass?
  answer: The required time commitment is 10 hours weekly (4 hrs live sessions) and self-paced learning (5-7 hrs/week). However, to get the most out of Compass, we suggest that founders spend 15 hours a week on the program.
- question: I have already participated in accelerators in the past. How is Compass different from other programs?
  answer: Compass by Founderland stands out as a program designed by founders for founders. Our focus is on helping historically marginalized entrepreneurs overcome common barriers to success. Our curriculum is tailored to provide practical training on navigating bias in negotiation and pitching. We firmly believe that hands-on workshops, practice, and role-play are essential for successfully raising your next round.
- question: Is the program virtual?
  answer: Yes, all of the programming is virtual at this time. We will do the Graduation and demo day in person, in Berlin, on June 16th from 4-6pm. (Details TBA)
