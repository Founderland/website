- question: What will program participants be doing? What are workshops like?
  answer: Each week, Compass by Founderland provides live sessions with expert coaches and mentors, many of whom have been both founders and investors. These sessions offer valuable insights and guidance to the cohort. Additionally, participants will have access to self-paced learning materials to help them practice what they have learned. To ensure accountability and support, we provide cohort members with accountability partners who can provide feedback and help each other improve outside the program.
- question: What will I gain from Compass?
  answer: In addition to Founderlandâ€™s existing community, resources, and perks, participants in Compass can expect to walk away with warm introductions to investors, a peer accountability network of founders and industry experts, and extensive experience and confidence in investor negotiation and pitching, especially in trickier situations where there is bias in play.
- question: What happens after Compass?
  answer: Upon completing the 5-week Compass by Founderland program, founders will be equipped with the skills, experience, and relationships needed to take their companies to the next level. With our help, founders can expect to master their pitch and confidently secure funding using the toolkit of investor skills and understanding developed during the program.
