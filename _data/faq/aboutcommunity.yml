- question: Who is within the Founderland community?
  answer: Founderland brings together women of colour founders, allies and investors to get more diverse, sustainable and scalable businesses funded. Our ecosystem is geographically focused on founders and businesses residing and operating in Europe and the UK. We are industry agnostic but require each founder to have a MVP.
- question: What if I don’t have an existing business?
  answer: If you don’t have an MVP but you are interested in becoming a founder we encourage you to join our community. Please send us an email hello AT founderland DOT org and subscribe to our Newsletter. We’ll keep your information on record and let you know when we have resources to help you get started!
- question: What if I’m based outside of Europe and the UK?
  answer:
    'Our current funding only allows us to support businesses within this region. However there are many amazing communities overseas for you to join. Here our top three:
    <ol><li>Afro Tech (for People of colour, US based)</li>
    <li>Create & Cultivate (for Women, US based)</li>
    <li>Digital Undivided (for Latina and Black Women Entrepreneurs, US based)</li></ol>'
- question: How is “woman of colour” defined by Founderland?
  answer: 'By ‘women of colour’, we refer to women who experience the effects of processes of racialisation, class and gender domination as well as other sources of inequality, particularly hierarchies of legal status (Bassel and Emejulu 2017). The women founders in our community hold ethnic backgrounds or heritage in Africa, the Caribbean, South & Central America, South & Southeast Asia and the Middle East.'
