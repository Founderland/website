                <p>A place without borders and boundaries.<br>
                    Where everyone is welcomed and celebrated.<br>
                    A place to put down roots and grow strong. Proud. Tall.</p>
                <p>It's like nowhere you've ever seen before.<br>
                    We lead where everyone else follows.<br>
                    We set a new standard.</p>
                <p>This is not business as usual.<br> We dream bigger and do better, and we claim space
                    without apology.<br>
                    We put money where it matters.</p>
                <p>We put community first, and check egos at the door.<br>
                    We build for ourselves and for those who'll come after us.<br>
                    Changing the game as we go.</p>
                <p class="font-bold">This is your land. This is Founderland.</p>
